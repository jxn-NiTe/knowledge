# How To Expose Time Theft To Optimize Workflow

* according to the Institute for the Study of Advanced Development, 2/3 of the population have a visual-spatial learning preference
* by making work visible, we can find meaningful patterns allowing us to improve our work
* in the following, go through real-world problems/examples/exercises, design a flow-based system (lean kanban flow) that makes work visible and thus combats the five time thieves
* not all subsequent examples may apply to your specific situation, take and apply what does, use the rest to gain understanding what others might be dealing with
* warning: the outcome of implementing these methods depends on the investment level of the participants

## Make Work Visible

* four requirements to make a visual work: structure, usefulness, relevance, honesty
* what we want to accomplish: easy on the eyes, accurate, meaningful, efficient at a glance
* since majority of population are visual-spatial learners, making work visible works with their brain and not against it
* by making work visible, we can find meaningful patterns allowing us to improve our work, or identify business pain points and other hidden information

Kanban boards

* simple, self-explanatory core: three stages -- to do, doing, done
* in practice, don't clutter to do column with too many items
* how to decide what to make visible? it depends
* demand analysis: what kind of work does the team do and what are the related problems (team pain, business pain), result will vary from team to team
* most common pain points: too many interruptions, conflicting priorities
* important to make internal customer pain visible, to get buy-in to limit WIP, and to optimize workflow across all teams to deliver business value
* once work demand and pain points are identified, consider work item categories since not all work is the same and have different levels of urgency or need different rules
* categories can be based on where requests originate from, or how it is prioritized, how metrics are gathered; 3 to 7 is a good number
* e.g. unplanned work, maintenance, business requests, team improvements
* people doing the work should always be involved with designing their workflow management system, not dictated by management
* the information your cards (tickets) hold should answer 'what data do you need to manage workflow?' and 'what do you want to measure', e.g.
  * card ID
  * header
  * title
  * description
  * assignee(s)
  * comment section
  * tags for query capability
  * icons for extra visibility
  * priority
  * subtasks or connected card fields
  * date field for date driven requests
* often times, need more granularity in the doing column which gets split out (e.g. prep, implement, review)
* do not over-engineer board design up front, further needs will become self-evident through usage

## Ambush The Ringleader

* Reasons why we take on more work than we have capacity to do?
  * we are team players and like to say 'yes'
  * fear of public humiliation or of getting fired
  * we do stuff for people we like
  * too optimistic in estimating effort
  * starting someting new and shiny is more fun that doing grunt work to finish something old
* too much WIP is bad enough on it's own but exacerbates all other problems (dependencies, unplanned work, conflicting priorities, neglected work)
* many ways to track WIP, including dividing WIP into categories based on requestor, e.g.
  * silver bullets: requests from leadership with urgent priority (perceived or otherwise)
  * business requests: things IT does that the business is involved with (features, design, ...)
  * teamwork: things IT does that the team initiates (tech debt, maintenance, security, ...)
* can use horizontal swimlanes for extra visibility, or to setup WIP limits
* hot to setup WIP limits is up to the team, possibilities include: per work item type, per swimlane, per column, per person
* WIP limits are the constraint that enable the completion of work by giving permission to people to say 'no'
* an expedited swimlane for leadership requests help to make their associated costs visible
* the longer items stay in the feedback column, the easier it is to forget details and takes longer to pick it up again (knowledge decay)
* visualizing work through the lens of flow improves team communication and understanding
* the combination of visuals (board structure, avatars, symbols) and writing (headers, card text) yields our desired unified language

## Expose Dependencies

* need to balance team size and dependencies across teams, i.e. from company-wide perspective, benefits of small, fast-moving teams diminishes when it leads to higher integration or coordination costs
* design board to highlight dependencies, e.g. by swimlanes or dependency tags
* important to visually call out dependencies between teams, e.g. by having parent ticket relationshiop to a different board, providing a heads-up on upcoming work
* prefer to organize around product teams to reduce problems associated with projects (costly and time consuming transition at project's end, rushing to meet deadline, missing dependency information leading to receiving team needing to interrupt delivering team and subsequent context switching)

## Committing The Perfect Crime - Unplanned Work

* there will always be unplanned work
* unplanned work should be made visible by a corresponding ticket
* this allows to calculate the ratio of unplanned to planned work, which can be reviewed regularly to adjust your WIP allocation strategy accordingly
* size doesn't matter when it comes to WIP limits (focus on just one thing at a time)
* strategies to help minimize the damage of unplanned work:
  * the goalie: rotating role for someone designated to run interference, protecting others from interruption
  * time-box some slots during the week to be available for others (office hours) or not at all (dnd hours)
  * pomodoro technique to focus
