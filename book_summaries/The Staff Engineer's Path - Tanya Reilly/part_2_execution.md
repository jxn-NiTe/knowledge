# Execution

## Finite Time

doing all the things

time

- opportunity cost, choosing something implicitly means choosing not do something else
- odd default that work calendar shows only meetings, i.e. the interruptions to focus work
- put specific non-meeting items in the calendar too (e.g. review proposal, write design doc etc.)
- this way you also know how much time for side-quests is available, when a new request can be answered, and things can be shuffled by priority
- leadership work can be unpredictable, so be aware how many hours you want to work in an average week and how many you are comfortable spiking to
- so have some buffer to react to unplanned obligations
- use the locator and treasure map to evaluate project's or activity's importance, then find a balance between choosing the most important work and what is right for you

resource constraints

- needs (not a comprehensive list but a useful model)
  - energy: understand what kinds of work are expensive for you and when it makes sense to start a task or not (e.g. debugging, 1:1 meetings, coding)
  - credibility: solve problems and show good technical judgement, avoid absolutism, be calm under stress, communicate clearly, balance between big picture and pragmatic local solution
  - quality of life: find balance of interesting work, enjoyable colleagues, money, optimizing for future happiness, having time outside work
  - skills: can become less relevant or outdated, so deliberately learn, work closely with skilled people, learn by doing
  - social capital: mix of trust, friendship feeling of owing someone, builds up over time (track record, repay for favours), invest it wisely
- when evaluation new projects, consider their effect on each resource, but don't overthink it for smaller tasks since perfect optimization is too difficult

choosing projects (using projects in a loose sense, any initiative or standalone task)

- where projects come from
  - you are invited to join: already momentum, but maybe not an growth opportunity (you are asked since you did something similar in the past)
  - you ask to join: be explicit about your intention
  - you have an idea: find a narrative to convince others
  - the fire alarm goes off: abrupt context switch, but clear goals and action oriented
  - claiming a problem (like a wonky API:) do as side quest since probably not highest priority, good to build up credibility and social capital
  - invited to join grassroots effort: can have huge impact or be huge waste of time, consider organizational buy-in, exit criteria, process for making decisions
  - someone needs to...: do fair share of work that belongs to no one
  - just meddling: can bring in good ideas but be wary to cause chaos and disengage before experiencing the consequences
- be clear with yourself about the shape of your tasks
  - projects can ramp up in approval phase
  - do meetings need prep time
  - can you hand off a process later on? define exit criteria
- questions to ask yourself
  - energy
    - how many things are you already doing
    - does this kind of work give or take energy
    - are you procrastinating (postpone big, complicated steps and fill the gap with low effort, low impact work)
    - is this fight worth it
  - quality of life
    - do you enjoy this work
    - how do you feel about the project's goals
  - credibility
    - does this project use your technical skills
    - does this project show your leadership skills
  - social capital
    - kind of work that company or manager expects at your level
    - will this work be respected
    - are you squandering the capital you have built (e.g. burn yourself on fixing a messy but low rate of change system)
  - skills
    - will this project teach you something you want to learn
    - will people around you raise your game
- what if it is the wrong project
  - do it anyway (is it short-term or has clear exit criteria?)
  - compensate for the project (have a side-quest that gives the lacking qualities of the main project, drop something to have more time and energy)
  - let others lead
  - resize the project (e.g. help in initial design phase)
  - don't do it
  - if you feel negatively about it, don't rationalize it away
- defend your time
